This is a simple application that will allow you to order items from a virtual store I created.
The app uses a mysql server to keep track of inventory and will catch you if you try to over order. The app 
will update its inventory after every order.

Each product has a unique integer id associated with it. The user should enter this id to specify the product he wants 
from the system.
